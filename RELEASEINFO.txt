Releases are not accurate until v1.6.1 because I didn't know about the existance of Github's releases!

The old releases before v1.6.1 were:

1.5.1
1.5.0
1.2.0
1.1.9
1.0.5
1.0.0

So whatever the # of releases Github shows, add +6!

You can view what each of the versions changed/removed/added in the comments at the top of the source code.
