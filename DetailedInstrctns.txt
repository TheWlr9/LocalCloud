STEP 1: SETTING UP AND STARTING YOUR CLOUD SERVER:
	OPTION 1: SETTING UP AND STARTING YOUR CLOUD SERVER NORMALLY:
		1. On the machine that will host the cloud server, download StrmServer.java from this Repo.
			a) Remember to download a copy of LICENCE as well!
		?2. Set the PORT number to whatever you want, in StrmServer.java. The default is 42843.
		2. Compile StrmServer.java by issuing the command: javac StrmServer.java
		3. In the same directory that holds the newly compiled StrmServer.class, create a new directory named "docs". This is
			where your "cloud" will store the files that have been uploaded.
		4. Run java StrmServer.class!
	
	OPTION 2: SETTING UP AND STARTING YOUR CLOUD SERVER AS A SERVICE:
		1. On the machine that will host the cloud server, download StrmServer.java, and StrmServer.sh from this Repo.
			a) Remember to download a copy of LICENCE as well!
		?2. Set the PORT number to whatever you want, in StrmServer.java. The default is 42843.
		2. Compile StrmServer.java by issuing the command: javac StrmServer.java
		3. In the same directory that holds the newly compiled StrmServer.class, create a new directory named "docs". This is
			where your "cloud" will store the files that have been uploaded.
		4. Edit StrmServer.sh so that the constants at the top of the file relate to your directories/files/etc.
		5. Run StrmServer.sh start!



STEP 2: SETTING UP A CLOUD CLIENT:
	Any computer that is connected to the *internet or WLAN, can become a client and access the cloud storage!
	1. On the computers you want to have access to the cloud storage on, download StrmClientBE.java, and the graphics folder,
		from the Repo.
		a) Remember to download a copy of LICENCE as well!
	?2. If you have changed the PORT number in StrmServer.java, change the PORT number to match the PORT number in
		StrmServer.java.
	2. Change the ADDRESS constant in StrmClientBE.java to match the IP address of your cloud host (the server machine).
		a) Remember, the ADDRESS constant is a String! So if your IP address is 127.0.0.101, change ADDRESS to "127.0.0.101".
	3. Compile StrmClientBE.java by issuing the command javac StrmClientBE.java
	4. Compile WindowedGraphics.java by issuing the 2 commands "cd graphics/" and "javac WindowedGraphics.java".
	5. Compile StrmClientUI.java by issuing the command "javac StrmClientUI.java".



STEP 3: STARTING A CLOUD CLIENT:
	1. Run java StrmClientBE.class whenever you want!



*Internet communication requires you to port forward to your set port number in the StrmServer.java

Notes:
The clients can connect to the server whenever the server is running, and if the client can access the IP address of the server.
If you are running the cloud server as a service, you can restart the service at any time by issuing the StrmServer.sh restart
command, and stop it by issuing the StrmServer.sh stop command.

If you want to access the cloud from outside your WLAN, all you have to do is port forward (the port number chosen) from your
public IP address to your local IP address, on your router. *WARNING*: As stated in the LICENCE, I am not responsible for any
invasions of privacy, attacks, or any other type of network hacking that may occur in opening a port on your router. This
application DOES NOT have any security measures to prevent unauthorized access into your cloud database! I may implement
something in the future, but this application was/is meant to only be a WLAN cloud, not a remote cloud.
