Instructions:
DO NOT MOVE FILES OUT OF THEIR FOLDERS
  Steps:
    1. Download StrmClient.zip on the computers that you want to be able to access your cloud
    2. Unzip the .zip file somewhere
    3. Double-click Strm.jar! (If you want to have a Desktop icon, create shortcut to Strm.jar and then move the shortcut onto your desktop.)
  Actions:
    - Clicking on the "Upload" button in the bottom right of the Client window, will upload any file you desire to the cloud, as long as 
      it is not restricted. This does not remove the file from the client, it only uploads a copy of the file to the cloud.
    - Clicking on a file in the Client window will download that file from the cloud into the Client (you get to choose where it gets 
      downloaded).
    - Clicking on the "next" and "prev" buttons at the bottom will navigate through the pages of files you have stored on the cloud.
